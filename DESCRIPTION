Description: Simulates the results of completed randomized controlled
    trials, as if they had been conducted as adaptive Multi-Arm Bandit
    (MAB) trials instead using data from the original experiment. Utilizes
    augmented inverse probability weighted estimatation (AIPW) to robustly
    estimate the probability of success for each treatment arm. Provides
    cutomization options to simulate perfect/imperfect information,
    stationary/non-stationary bandits, treatment blocking, and control
    augmentation strategy for assigning treatment arms.
