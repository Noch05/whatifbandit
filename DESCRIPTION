Description: Simulates the results of completed randomized controlled
    trials, as if they had been conducted as adaptive Multi-Arm Bandit
    (MAB) trials instead. Augmented inverse probability weighted
    estimation (AIPW), outlined by Hadad et al. (2021)
    <doi:10.1073/pnas.2014602118>, is used to robustly estimate the
    probability of success for each treatment arm under the adaptive
    conditions. Provides customization options to simulate
    perfect/imperfect information, stationary/non-stationary bandits,
    treatment blocking, along with control augmentation, and other hybrid
    strategies for assigning treatment arms. The methods used in
    simulation were inspired Offer-Westort et al.  (2021)
    <doi:10.1111/ajps.12597>.
