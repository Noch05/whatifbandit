Description: Simulates the results of completed randomized controlled
    trials, as if they had been conducted as adaptive Multi-Arm Bandit
    (MAB) trials instead. Augmented inverse probability weighted
    estimation (AIPW) is used to robustly estimate the probability of
    success for each treatment arm under the adaptive conditions. Provides
    customization options to simulate perfect/imperfect information,
    stationary/non-stationary bandits, treatment blocking, along with
    control augmentation, and hybrid strategies for assigning treatment
    arms.
