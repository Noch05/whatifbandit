Description: Simulates the results of completed randomized controlled
    trials, as if they had been conducted as adaptive Multi-Arm Bandit
    (MAB) trials instead. Augmented inverse probability weighted estimation (AIPW) is used 
    to robustly estimate the probability of success for each treatment arm 
    under the adaptive conditions. Provides customization options to simulate 
    perfect/imperfect information, stationary/non-stationary bandits, 
    treatment blocking, and control augmentation strategy for assigning treatment arms.
