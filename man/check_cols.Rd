\usage{
check_cols(
  assignment_method,
  time_unit,
  perfect_assignment,
  col_names,
  data,
  verbose
)
}
\arguments{
\item{assignment_method}{String; "Date" or "Batch" to define the assignment into treatment waves.}

\item{time_unit}{A string specifying the unit of time for assigning periods when 'assignment_method` is 'date'
Acceptable values are "Day", "Week", or "Month".}

\item{perfect_assignment}{Logical; if TRUE, assumes perfect information for treatment assignment
(i.e., all outcomes are observed regardless of the date).
If FALSE, hides outcomes not yet theoretically observed, based
on the dates treatments would have been assigned for each wave.}

\item{col_names}{Names of the columns as strings passed from user's input into \code{\link[=sinlge_mab_simulation]{sinlge_mab_simulation()}} or \code{\link[=multiple_mab_simulation]{multiple_mab_simulation()}}}

\item{data}{A data frame, tibble or data.table that provides the input data for the trial.}

\item{verbose}{Logical; Whether or not to print iteration number. FALSE by default.}
}
\value{
Throws an error if columns are not properly declared or in data
}
\description{
Takes the user's settings as input, and checks the required columns against
which ones are provided, and throws in error if the user did not provide a required column, or
the column they provide is not present in their data.
