\usage{
\method{get_bandit}{Thompson}(past_results, conditions, iterator, current_period)
}
\arguments{
\item{past_results}{tibble/data.table containing summary of prior periods, with
successes, number of observations, and success rates, which is created by \code{\link[=get_past_results]{get_past_results()}}.}

\item{conditions}{A named character vector containing treatment conditions. The elements
of this vector should be the names of each treatment as seen in your data, so to create it you can simply call
\code{unique(df[[condition_col_name]])}. The names of each element are used to reference the contents but are not inherently important;
choose names that are meaningful and consistent. If \code{control_augment} > 0, then the control condition
of the trial in this vector must have the name "Control".}

\item{iterator}{Counter variable; keeps track of recursive calls to prevent infinite recursion.}

\item{current_period}{Numeric scalar; current period of the adaptive trial simulation.}
}
\value{
Named Numeric Vector of Posterior Probabilities
}
\description{
Thompson Sampling Algorithm
}
\details{
Thompson Sampling is calculated using the \href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bandit/index.html}{bandit}
package, and has some issues with numerical stability with extremely large numbers, in the case of instability
where it returns a vector of 0's or NaNs, the process is redone after dividing all the
success and total vectors for treatment arm by 2, preserving the proportions. This is implemented
recursively and executes a max of 50 times.
