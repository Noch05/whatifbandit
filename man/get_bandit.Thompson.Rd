\usage{
\method{get_bandit}{Thompson}(past_results, conditions, current_period, ndraws)
}
\arguments{
\item{past_results}{tibble/data.table containing summary of prior periods, with
successes, number of observations, and success rates, which is created by \code{\link[=get_past_results]{get_past_results()}}.}

\item{conditions}{A named character vector containing treatment conditions. The elements
of this vector should be the names of each treatment as seen in your data, so to create it you can simply call
\code{unique(df[[condition_col_name]])}. The names of each element are used to reference the contents but are not inherently important;
choose names that are meaningful and consistent. If \code{control_augment} > 0, then the control condition
of the trial in this vector must have the name "Control".}

\item{current_period}{Numeric scalar; current period of the adaptive trial simulation.}

\item{ndraws}{A numeric value; When Thompson Sampling direct calculations fail, draws from a simulated posterior
will be used to approximate the Thompson Sampling probabilities. This is the number of simulations to use, the default
is 5000 to match the default parameter \code{\link[bandit:best_binomial_bandit_sim]{bandit::best_binomial_bandit_sim()}}, but might need to be raised or lowered depending on perfomance and accuracy
concerns.}

Named Numeric Vector of Posterior Probabilities

\description{
Thompson Sampling Algorithm
}
\details{
Thompson Sampling is calculated using the \href{https://cran.r-project.org/package=bandit}{bandit}
package using R's integrate function which can overflow. If overflow errors occur, the Thompson Sampling
probabilities will be calculated by simulating draws from the posterior instead of direct calculations.
