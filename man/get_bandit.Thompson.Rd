\usage{
\method{get_bandit}{Thompson}(past_results, conditions, iterator)
}
\arguments{
\item{past_results}{\code{data} object containing summary of prior periods.
Created by \code{\link[=get_past_results]{get_past_results()}}.}

\item{conditions}{A named character vector containing treatment conditions. The elements
of this vector should be the names of each treatment as seen in your data, so to create it you can simply call
\code{unique(df[[condition_col_name]])}. The names of each element are used to reference the contents but are not inherently important;
choose names that are meaningful and consistent. If \code{control_augment} > 0, then the control condition
of the trial in this vector must have the name "Control".}

\item{iterator}{counter variable; keeps track of recursive calls to prevent infinite recursion.}
}
\value{
Named Numeric Vector of Posterior Probabilities
}
