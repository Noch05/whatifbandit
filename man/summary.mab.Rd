\title{Summary Generic for "mab" class}
\usage{
\method{summary}{mab}(object, level = 0.95, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{`mab`` class object created by \code{\link[=single_mab_simulation]{single_mab_simulation()}}.}

\item{level}{Numeric value of length 1; indicates confidence interval Width (i.e 0.90, .95, 0.99).
Defaults to 0.95}

\item{...}{additional arguments.}
}
\value{
tibble containg each treatment, the final Thompson/UCB1 Statistic,
the AIPW estimate and Normal CI based on user supplied level.
}
\description{
Summarizes the Results of a Single Multi-Arm Bandit Trial. Provides
confidence intervals around the AIPW estimates, and the final calculations
of the Thompson Probabilities or UCB1 statistics for each arm.
}
\details{
The confidence intervals applied follow a standard normal distribution
because it is assumed the AIPW estimators are asymptotically normal as shown
in \href{https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2014602118}{Hadad et al. (2021)}

\code{...} is provided to be compatibile with \code{summary()} it does not change
anything in the execution.

All of the data provided to create a table like this is present in the object
created by \code{\link[=single_mab_simulation]{single_mab_simulation()}} but
this provides a simple shortcut, which is useful when testing many
different simulations.
}
\examples{
# Objects returned by `single_mab_simulation()` have a `mab` class.
# This class has a summary generic that can produce quick results of the trial.

# Loading Data and running a quick simulation
data(tanf)
x <- single_mab_simulation(
  data = tanf,
  algorithm = "Thompson",
  assignment_method = "Batch",
  period_length = 600,
  whole_experiment = TRUE,
  perfect_assignment = TRUE,
  blocking = FALSE,
  prior_periods = "All",
  conditions = c(
    "no_letter",
    "open_appt",
    "specific_appt"
  ),
  data_cols = c(
    condition_col = "condition",
    id_col = "ic_case_id",
    success_col = "success"
  )
)

# Calling `summary` Returns a summary table for the trial
# Defaults to 95\% Normal Confidence Intervals
# for the Augmented Inverse Probability Estimates
summary(x)

# We can also change the confidence level to anything between 0 and 1
summary(x, level = 0.7)

# Invalid levels throw an error
try(summary(x, level = 5))
