\title{Summary Generic for "mab" class}
\usage{
\method{summary}{mab}(object, level = 0.95, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{`mab`` class object created by \code{\link[=single_mab_simulation]{single_mab_simulation()}}.}

\item{level}{Numeric value of length 1; indicates confidence interval Width (i.e 0.90, .95, 0.99).
Defaults to 0.95}

\item{...}{additional arguments.}
}
\value{
Tibble containing summary information from the trial.
}
\description{
Summarizes the Results of a Single Multi-Arm Bandit Trial. Provides
confidence intervals around the AIPW estimates, and the final calculations
of the Thompson sampling probabilities or UCB1 valuess for each arm.
}
\details{
The confidence intervals applied follow a standard normal distribution
because it is assumed the AIPW estimators are asymptotically normal as shown
in \href{https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2014602118}{Hadad et al. (2021)}

\code{...} is provided to be compatible with \code{summary()}, the function
does not have any additional arguments.

All of the data provided to create a table like this is present in the object
created by \code{\link[=single_mab_simulation]{single_mab_simulation()}} but
this provides a simple shortcut, which is useful when testing many
different simulations.
}
\examples{
# Objects returned by `single_mab_simulation()` have a `mab` class.
# This class has a summary generic that can produce quick results of the trial.

# Loading Data and running a quick simulation
data(tanf)

  data = tanf,
  algorithm = "Thompson",
  assignment_method = "Batch",
  period_length = 600,

  perfect_assignment = TRUE,
  blocking = FALSE,

# Creating summary table
## Defaults to 95\% confidence interval
summary(x) |> print(width = Inf)

## 70\% confidence level
summary(x, level = 0.7) |> print(width = Inf)
