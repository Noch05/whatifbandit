\usage{
\method{create_new_cols}{data.table}(data, data_cols, blocking, block_cols, perfect_assignment)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame, tibble or data.table that provides the input data for the trial.}

\item{data_cols}{Named Character vector containing the names of columns in data as strings:
\itemize{
\item{id_col:} {Column in data, contains unique id as a key}
\item{success_col:} {Column in data; Binary successes from original experiment}
\item{date_col:} {Column in data, contains original date of event/trial; only ncessary when assigning by 'Date'}
\item{month_col:} {Column in data, contains month of treatment; only necessary when time_unit = 'Month'}
\item{success_date_col:} {Column in data, contains original dates each success occured; only necessary when 'perfect_assignment' = FALSE}
\item{assignment_date_col:} {Column in data, contains original dates treatments are assigned to observations; only necessary when 'perfect_assignment' = FALSE.
Used to simulate imperfect information on part of researchers conducting an adaptive trial}}}

\item{blocking}{Logical; Whether or not to use treatment blocking.}

\item{block_cols}{Character Vector of variables to block by.}

\item{perfect_assignment}{Logical; if TRUE, assumes perfect information for treatment assignment
(i.e., all outcomes are observed regardless of the date).
If FALSE, hides outcomes not yet theoretically observed, based
on the dates treatments would have been assigned for each wave.}
