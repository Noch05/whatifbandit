\title{Create Prior Periods}
\usage{
create_prior(prior_periods, current_period)
}
\arguments{
\item{prior_periods}{A numeric value of length 1, or the character string "All"; number of previous periods to use
in the treatment assignment model. This is used to implement the stationary/non-stationary bandit.
For example, a non-stationary bandit assumes the true probability of success for each treatment changes over time, so to
account for that, not all prior data should be used when making decisions because it could be "out of date".}

\item{current_period}{The current period of the simulation. Defined by loop structure inside \code{\link[=run_mab_trial]{run_mab_trial()}}.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector containing the prior treatment periods to be used when aggregating
the results for the current treatment assignment period.
}
\description{
Used during \code{\link[=run_mab_trial]{run_mab_trial()}} to create a vector of prior periods dynamically. Used to create
the proper vector when \code{prior_periods} is not "All" and therefore not all the periods less than the current one.
