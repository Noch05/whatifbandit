\usage{
\method{plot}{multiple.mab}(
  x,
  type,
  quantity,
  cdf = NULL,
  level = 0.95,
  save = FALSE,
  path = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{multiple.mab} class object created by \code{\link[=multiple_mab_simulation]{multiple_mab_simulation()}}}

\item{type}{String; Type of plot requested; valid types are:
\itemize{
\item \code{summary}: Shows the number of times each arm was selected as the highest chance of being the best.
\item \code{hist}: Shows histograms for each treatment condition's proportion of success across trials or number of obersvations assigned.
\item \code{estimate}: Shows proportion of success estimates using specified normal or empirical confidence intervals.
}}

\item{quantity}{The quantities to plot when \code{type = "hist"}, accepts either 'estimate' to plot the distributuons of the AIPW estimates, or
'assignment' to plot the distributions of the number of observations assigned to each treatment across the repeated trials.}

\item{cdf}{String; specifies the type of CDF to use when analyzing the estimates.
valid CDFs are the 'empirical' CDF, the 'normal' CDF. Used when type = \code{estimate}. The 'normal' CDF uses the fact
that the AIPW estimates are asymptotically normal, while the empirical CDF estimates the CDF from the sample
of AIPW estimates.}

\item{level}{Numeric value of length 1; indicates confidence interval Width (i.e 0.90, .95, 0.99).
Defaults to 0.95}

\item{save}{Logical; Whether or not to save the plot to disk; FALSE by default.}

\item{path}{String; File directory to save file.}

\item{...}{Arguments to pass to \verb{ggplot2::geom_*} function (e.g. \code{color}, \code{linewidth}, \code{alpha}, \code{bins} etc.). In the case of \code{type = "hist"}, additional
arguments must be passed in to distinct lists, one named \code{geom} which are passed to \verb{ggplot2::geom_*} and one named \code{facet} which are passed to \code{ggplot2::facet_grid}.
to \verb{ggplot2::geom_*}
should be a named list with 2 components, 'geom' and 'facet', to distinguish between arguments passed to \code{ggplot2::geom_histogram} and \code{ggplot2::facet_grid()}.}
}
\value{
Minimal ggplot object, that can be customized and added to with \code{+} (to change, scales, labels, legend, theme, etc.)
}
\description{
Uses \code{\link[ggplot2:ggplot]{ggplot2::ggplot()}} to plot the results of multiple
Multi-Arm Bandit Trials
}
\details{
The plot generic requires \href{https://cran.r-project.org/package=ggplot2}{ggplot2}
which is not required by the package, so it must be installed separately.

This function provides minimalist plots to quickly view the results of the procedure
and has the ability to be customized through the \code{...}
in the call and \code{+} afterwords. However, all the data necessary is
provided in the output of \code{\link[=multiple_mab_simulation]{multiple_mab_simulation()}} for extreme
customization or professional plots, it is highly recommended
to start completely from scratch and not use the generic.
