\usage{
\method{plot}{multiple.mab}(
  x,
  type,
  estimator = NULL,
  cdf = NULL,
  level = 0.95,
  save = FALSE,
  path = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{multiple.mab} class object created by \code{\link[=multiple_mab_simulation]{multiple_mab_simulation()}}}

\item{type}{String; Type of plot requested; valid types are:
\itemize{
\item \code{summary}: Shows the number of times each arm was selected as the highest chance of being the best.
\item \code{hist}: Shows histograms for each treatment condition's proportion of success across trials.
\item \code{estimate}: Shows proportion of success estimates user specified normal or empirical confidence intervals.
}}

\item{estimator}{Estimator to plot; Either "AIPW", "Sample" or "Both"; used by \code{hist} and \code{estimate}.}

\item{cdf}{String; specifies the type of CDF to use when analyzing the estimates.
valid cdfs are the \code{empirical} cdf, the \code{normal} cdf. Used when type = \code{estimate}.}

\item{level}{Confidence Interval Width (i.e 0.90, .95, 0.99)}

\item{save}{Logical; Whether or not to save the plot to disk; FALSE by default.}

\item{path}{String; File directory to save file.}

\item{...}{arguments to pass to \verb{ggplot2:geom_*} function (e.g. \code{color}, \code{linewidth}, \code{alpha}, \code{bins} etc.)}
}
\value{
Minimal ggplot object, that can be customized and added to with \code{+} (To change, scales, labels, legend, theme, etc.)
}

Uses \code{\link[ggplot2:ggplot]{ggplot2::ggplot()}} to summarize the results of multiple
Multi-Arm Bandit Trials

  # The plot generic has several options
  # Specify type = summary, to get a bar graph showing each time

  # type = hist, creates a histogram of AIPW, Sample, or Both estimates for each
  # treatment over each trial
  plot(x, type = "hist", estimator = "AIPW")

  # type = estimate creates a similar error bar plot like in plot.mab()
  # but here the empirical variance of the estimate can be used instead
