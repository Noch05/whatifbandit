}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame, tibble or data.table that provides the input data for the trial.}

\item{data_cols}{Named Character vector containing the names of columns in data as strings:
\itemize{
\item{id_col:} {Column in data, contains unique id as a key}
\item{success_col:} {Column in data; Binary successes from original experiment}
\item{date_col:} {Column in data, contains original date of event/trial; only ncessary when assigning by 'Date'}
\item{month_col:} {Column in data, contains month of treatment; only necessary when time_unit = 'Month'}
\item{success_date_col:} {Column in data, contains original dates each success occured; only necessary when 'perfect_assignment' = FALSE}
\item{assignment_date_col:} {Column in data, contains original dates treatments are assigned to observations; only necessary when 'perfect_assignment' = FALSE.
Used to simulate imperfect information on part of researchers conducting an adaptive trial}}}

\item{block_cols}{Character Vector of variables to block by.}

\item{time_unit}{A string specifying the unit of time for assigning periods when 'assignment_method` is 'date'.
Acceptable values are "Day", "Week", or "Month".}

\item{period_length}{Numeric; length of each treatment period.
If assignment method is "Date", this refers to the
length of periods by your specified \code{time_unit} (i.e., if "Day", 10 would be 10 days).
If assignment methods is "Batch", this refers to the number of people in each batch.}

\item{perfect_assignment}{Logical; if TRUE, assumes perfect information for treatment assignment
(i.e., all outcomes are observed regardless of the date).
If FALSE, hides outcomes not yet theoretically observed, based
on the dates treatments would have been assigned for each wave.}

\item{assignment_method}{String; "Date" or "Batch" to define the assignment into treatment waves.}

\item{blocking}{Logical; Whether or not to use treatment blocking.}

\item{verbose}{Logical; Whether or not to print iteration number. FALSE by default.}
}
\value{
A prepared data object of the same class as \code{data},
containing all the columns required by \code{\link[=mab_simulation]{mab_simulation()}}.
}
\description{
Transforms user-provided input data for use with \code{\link[=mab_simulation]{mab_simulation()}}. Adds
additional columns to ensure compatibility.
