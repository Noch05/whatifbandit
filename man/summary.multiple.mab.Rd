\usage{
\method{summary}{multiple.mab}(object, level = 0.95, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{multiple.mab} object created by \link{multiple_mab_simulation}}

\item{level}{Numeric value of length 1; indicates confidence interval Width (i.e 0.90, .95, 0.99).
Defaults to 0.95}

\item{...}{additional arguments.}
}
\description{
Summarizes results of of multiple Multi-Arm Bandit Trials
}
\details{
This summary provides the number of times each treatment arm was
selected as the best, chosen by the highest UCB1 or Thompson Probability
from the end of each trial.

Additional it provides the average of the AIPW and sample estimates
across all trials, while also providing 2 distinct variances and intervals.
One interval is based on the average of the variances, and uses a normal distribution,
while the other empirical distribution had its variance estimated
using the sample of AIPW estimates which is used to construct
empirical confidence intervals. These empirical
variances represent the variation in each simulation due to the random state

#' \code{...} is provided to be compatible with \code{summary()}, these arguments do
not change anything.

# Calling `summary` Returns a summary table for the trial
