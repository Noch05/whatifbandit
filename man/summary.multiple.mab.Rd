\title{Summary Generic for "multiple.mab" class}
\usage{
\method{summary}{multiple.mab}(object, level = 0.95, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{multiple.mab} object created by \link{multiple_mab_simulation}}

\item{level}{Numeric value of length 1; indicates confidence interval Width (i.e 0.90, .95, 0.99).
Defaults to 0.95}

\item{...}{additional arguments.}
}
\value{
Tibble containing summary information for repeated trials.
}
\description{
Summarizes results of of multiple Multi-Arm Bandit Trials. Provides empirically estimated
and normally approximated confidence intervals on AIPW estimates for probability of success, and
the number of times each arm was the chosen as the best treatment across all simulations.
}
\details{
This summary provides the number of times each treatment arm was
selected as the best, chosen by the highest UCB1 or Thompson sampling probabilities
from the end of each trial.

Additionally it provides the average of the AIPW and sample estimates
across all trials, while also providing 2 distinct variances and intervals.
One interval is based on the average of the variances, and uses a normal distribution,
while an empirical distribution is estimated using the sample of estimates
created by the repeated trials. These empirical
variances represent the variation in each simulation due to the random state

\code{...} is provided to be compatible with \code{summary()}, the function
does not have any additional arguments.
