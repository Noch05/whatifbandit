\title{Create Necessary Columns for Multi-Arm Bandit Trial}
\usage{
create_new_cols(data, data_cols, block_cols, blocking, perfect_assignment)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame, tibble or data.table that provides the input data for the trial.}

\item{data_cols}{Named Character vector containing the names of columns in data as strings:
\itemize{
\item \code{id_col}: Column in data, contains unique id as a key.
\item \code{success_col}: Column in data; Binary successes from original experiment.
\item \code{condition_col}: Column in data; Original Treatment condition for each observation.
\item \code{date_col}: Column in data, contains original date of event/trial; only necessary when assigning by 'Date'.
\item \code{month_col}: Column in data, contains month of treatment; only necessary when time_unit = 'Month'.
\item \code{success_date_col}: Column in data, contains original dates each success occurred; only necessary when 'perfect_assignment' = FALSE.
\item \code{assignment_date_col}: Column in data, contains original dates treatments are assigned to observations; only necessary when 'perfect_assignment' = FALSE.
Used to simulate imperfect information on part of researchers conducting an adaptive trial.
}}

\item{block_cols}{Character Vector of variables to block by.}

\item{blocking}{Logical; Whether or not to use treatment blocking.}

\item{perfect_assignment}{Logical; if TRUE, assumes perfect information for treatment assignment
(i.e., all outcomes are observed regardless of the date).
If FALSE, hides outcomes not yet theoretically observed, based
on the dates treatments would have been assigned for each wave.}
}
\value{
Updated \code{data} object of same class with 6 new columns:
\itemize{
\item mab_success: New variable to hold new success from Multi-arm bandit procedure, NA until assigned.
\item mab_condition: New variable to hold new treatment condition from Multi-arm bandit procedure, NA until assigned.
\item impute_req: Binary indicator for imputation requirement, NA until assigned.
\item new_success_date: New variable to new recertification date from Multi-arm bandit procedure, NA until assigned.
\item block New variable indicating the variables to block by for assignment.
\item treatment_block New variable combining block with original treatment condition.
}
}
\description{
Initializes partially empty columns in \code{data}, to ensure compatibility with, \code{\link[=mab_simulation]{mab_simulation()}}.
These are initialized as \code{NA} except for observations with \code{period_number} = 1, whose are the starting point for
the adaptive trial.
