\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame, tibble or data.table that provides the input data for the trial.}

\item{time_unit}{A string specifying the unit of time for assigning periods when 'assignment_method` is 'date'.
Acceptable values are "Day", "Week", or "Month".}

\item{period_length}{Numeric; length of each treatment period.
If assignment method is "Date", this refers to the
length of periods by your specified \code{time_unit} (i.e., if "Day", 10 would be 10 days).
If assignment methods is "Batch", this refers to the number of people in each batch.}

\item{data_cols}{Named Character vector containing the names of columns in data as strings:
\itemize{
\item \code{id_col}: Column in data, contains unique id as a key.
\item \code{success_col}: Column in data; Binary successes from original experiment.
\item \code{condition_col}: Column in data; Original Treatment condition for each observation.
\item \code{date_col}: Column in data, contains original date of event/trial; only ncessary when assigning by 'Date'.
\item \code{month_col}: Column in data, contains month of treatment; only necessary when time_unit = 'Month'.
\item \code{success_date_col}: Column in data, contains original dates each success occured; only necessary when 'perfect_assignment' = FALSE.
\item \code{assignment_date_col}: Column in data, contains original dates treatments are assigned to observations; only necessary when 'perfect_assignment' = FALSE.
Used to simulate imperfect information on part of researchers conducting an adaptive trial.
}}

\item{block_cols}{Character Vector of variables to block by.}

\item{blocking}{Logical; Whether or not to use treatment blocking.}

\item{prior_periods}{Numeric; number of previous periods to use in the treatment assignment model
or specify string "All" to use all previous periods.}

\item{algorithm}{A string specifying the MAB algorithm to use. Options are "Thompson" or "UCB1".}

\item{whole_experiment}{Logical; if TRUE, uses all past experimental data for imputing outcomes.
If FALSE, uses only data available up to the current period.}

\item{perfect_assignment}{Logical; if TRUE, assumes perfect information for treatment assignment
(i.e., all outcomes are observed regardless of the date).
If FALSE, hides outcomes not yet theoretically observed, based
on the dates treatments would have been assigned for each wave.}

\item{conditions}{Named Character vector containing treatment conditions.
Control condition, must be named "Control" when 'control_augment' > 0.}

\item{verbose}{Logical; Whether or not to print iteration number. FALSE by default.}

\item{control_augment}{Number \eqn{\in} [0,1]; Proportion of each wave guaranteed to get "Control" treatment.
Default is 0.}

\item{imputation_information}{Object created by \code{\link[=imputation_prep]{imputation_prep()}} containing the conditional means and success dates
for each treatment block to impute from.}
}
\value{
A named list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{final_data}: Processed data with new treatment assignments and imputed outcomes labelled with "mab_" prefix.
\item \code{bandits}: Thompson Probability or UCB1 statistic for each treatment arm at each period of the simulation.
\item \code{assignment_probs}: Assignment probabilities for each treatment arm at each period of the simulation.}
}
\description{
Performs a full Multi-Arm Bandit (MAB) trial using Thompson Sampling or UCB1.
The function provides loop around each step of the process for each treatment wave, performing adaptive
treatment assignment, and outcome imputation. Supports flexible customization in treatment blocking strategy,
the size of each treatment wave, and information availability to simulate both a real experiment, and non-stationary
bandit strategy.
