\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.frame, data.table, or tibble containing input data from the trial. This should be the results
of a traditional Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT). data.frames will be converted to tibbles internally.}

\item{time_unit}{A character string specifying the unit of time for assigning periods when \code{assignment_method} is "Date".
Acceptable values are "Day", "Week", or "Month". "Month" is a special case that is useful when an experiment
defines the months differently then the genuine dates, i.e. an experiment considers August as starting
the in the second half of July, or when exact calender months are required for the periods, not just
a lengths of time in the month range. As such it requires an additional column to be provided,
with the exact month desired for each observation passed as an integer, character, or factor. Each
observation is treated as occurring on the first of each month.}

\item{period_length}{A numeric value of length 1; represents the length of each treatment period.
If assignment method is "Date", this length refers the number of units specified in\code{time_unit}
(i.e., if "Day", 10 would be 10 days).
If assignment method is "Batch", this refers to the number of people in each batch. This factor
contributes most to the computational cost of calling the function, as large batch sizes make each iteration of
the simulation run slower, while each additional period adds time because of the extra iterations, so be exercise
caution with this argument.}

\item{data_cols}{A named character vector containing the names of columns in \code{data} as strings:
\itemize{
\item \code{id_col}: Column in \code{data}; contains unique ID as a key.
\item \code{success_col}: Column in \code{data}; binary successes from the original experiment.
\item \code{condition_col}: Column in \code{data}; original treatment condition for each observation.
\item \code{date_col}: Column in \code{data}; contains original date of event/trial. Only necessary when assigning by "Date". Must be of type \code{Date}, not a character string.
\item \code{month_col}: Column in \code{data}; contains month of treatment. Only necessary when \code{time_unit = "Month"}. This can be a string or factor variable
containing the names or numbers of months.
\item \code{success_date_col}: Column in \code{data}; contains original dates each success occurred. Only necessary when \code{perfect_assignment = FALSE}. Must be of type \code{Date}, not a character string.
\item \code{assignment_date_col}: Column in \code{data}; contains original dates treatments were assigned to observations. Only necessary when \code{perfect_assignment = FALSE}.
Used to simulate imperfect information on the part of researchers conducting an adaptive trial. Must be of type \code{Date}, not a character string.
}}

\item{block_cols}{A character vector of variables to block by. This vector should not be named.}

\item{blocking}{A logical value; whether or not to use treatment blocking. Treatment blocking is used to ensure an even-enough
distribution of treatment conditions across blocks. For example, blocking by gender would mean the randomized assignment should
split treatments evenly not just throughout the sample (so for 4 arms, 25-25-25-25), but also within each block, so 25\% of men
would receive each treatment and 25\% of women the same. This is most useful when the blocks are uneven or have some geographic meaning.}

\item{prior_periods}{A numeric value of length 1, or the character string "All"; number of previous periods to use
in the treatment assignment model. This is used to implement the stationary/non-stationary bandit.
For example, a non-stationary bandit assumes the true probability of success for each treatment changes over time, so to
account for that, not all prior data should be used when making decisions because it could be "out of date".}

\item{algorithm}{A character string specifying the MAB algorithm to use. Options are "Thompson" or "UCB1". Algorithm
defines the adaptive assignment process. Mathematical details on these algorithms
can be found in \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.6028}{Kuleshov and Precup 2014} and
\href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07272}{Slivkins 2024}.}

\item{whole_experiment}{A logical value; if TRUE, uses all past experimental data for imputing outcomes.
If FALSE, uses only data available up to the current period. In large datasets or with a high number
of periods, setting this to FALSE can be more computationally intensive, though not a significant
contributor to total run time.}

\item{perfect_assignment}{A logical value; if TRUE, assumes perfect information for treatment assignment
(i.e., all outcomes are observed regardless of the date).
If FALSE, hides outcomes not yet theoretically observed, based
on the dates treatments would have been assigned for each wave.
This is useful when simulating batch-based assignment where treatments were assigned
on a given day whether or not all the information from a prior batch was available and
you have exact dates treatments were assigned.}

\item{conditions}{A named character vector containing treatment conditions. The elements
of this vector should be the names of each treatment as seen in your data, so to create it you can simply call
\code{unique(df[[condition_col]])}. The names of each element are used to reference the contents but are not inherently important;
choose names that are meaningful and consistent. If \code{control_augment} > 0, then the control condition
of the trial in this vector must have the name "Control".}

\item{verbose}{A logical value; whether or not to print intermediate messages. Default is FALSE.}

\item{control_augment}{A numeric value ranging from 0 to 1; proportion of each wave guaranteed to receive the "Control" treatment.
Default is 0. It is not recommended to use this in conjunction with \code{random_assign_prop}.}

\item{imputation_information}{Object created by \code{\link[=imputation_precompute]{imputation_precompute()}} containing the conditional means and success dates
for each treatment block to impute from.}

\item{ndraws}{A numeric value; When Thompson sampling direct calculations fail, draws from a simulated posterior
will be used to approximate the Thompson sampling probabilities. This is the number of simulations to use, the default
is 5000 to match the default parameter \code{\link[bandit:best_binomial_bandit_sim]{bandit::best_binomial_bandit_sim()}}, but might need to be raised or lowered depending on performance and accuracy
concerns.}

\item{random_assign_prop}{a numeric value ranging from 0 to 1; proportion of each wave to be assigned new treatments randomly,
1 - \code{random_assign_prop} is the proportion assigned through the bandit procedure. For example if this is set to 0.1, then
for each wave 10\% of the observations will be randomly assigned to a new treatment, while the remaining 90\% will be assigned according
to UCB1 or Thompson result. It is not recommended to use this in conjunction with \code{control_augment}. If batch sizes are small,
and the number of rows is calculate to be less than 1, and probability sampling approach is used where each row in the batch
will have a \code{random_assign_prop} probability of being selected for random assignment. Otherwise the number is rounded to
a whole number, and that many rows are selected for random assignment.}
}
\value{
A named list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{final_data}: The processed tibble or data.table, containing new columns pertaining to the results of the trial.
\item \code{bandits}: A tibble or data.table containing the UCB1 valuess or Thompson sampling posterior distributions for each period.
\item \code{assignment_probs}: A tibble or data.table containing the probability of being assigned each treatment arm at a given period.
}
}
\description{
Performs a full Multi-Arm Bandit (MAB) trial using Thompson sampling or UCB1.
The function provides loop around each step of the process for each treatment wave, performing adaptive
treatment assignment, and outcome imputation. Supports flexible customization passed
from \code{\link[=single_mab_simulation]{single_mab_simulation()}} and \code{\link[=multiple_mab_simulation]{multiple_mab_simulation()}} in treatment blocking strategy,
stationary/non-stationary bandits, control augmentation, and hybrid assignment.
}
\details{
The first period is used to start the trial, so the MAB loop
starts at period number 2.
