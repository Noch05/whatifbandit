\usage{
check_impute(imputation_information, current_data, current_period)
}
\arguments{
\item{imputation_information}{\code{original_summary} element of the \code{imputation_information}
list created by \code{\link[=imputation_precompute]{imputation_precompute()}} for the given period.}

\item{current_data}{tibble/data.table with only observations from the current sampling period.}

\item{current_period}{Numeric value of length 1; current treatment wave of the simulation.}
}
\description{
Subsets or adds to tibble/data.frame created by \code{\link[=imputation_precompute]{imputation_precompute()}},
to ensure compatibility with \code{\link[randomizr:block_and_cluster_ra]{randomizr::block_and_cluster_ra()}}.
}
\details{
\code{\link[randomizr:block_and_cluster_ra]{randomizr::block_and_cluster_ra()}} does not see the names
of the probabilities passed per block, so the imputation information must be subsetted
to only contain blocks which are present in a period, and sorted to comply with
\code{\link[randomizr:block_and_cluster_ra]{randomizr::block_and_cluster_ra()}}'s internal ordering.

When blocks are required but do not exist in the information provided it is added
to the tibble.data.table, with an estimated conditional probability of success as
the average across other blocks.

When blocks are present but not required, they are removed from the
tibble/data.table.
