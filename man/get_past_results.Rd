\usage{
get_past_results(
  data,
  prior,
  current_period,
  perfect_assignment,
  assignment_date_col,
  success_date_col,
  conditions
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data.frame object containing appropriate columns created by \code{\link[=create_cutoff]{create_cutoff()}}, and
results of previous periods of the MAB procedure.}

\item{prior}{Numeric vector containing the prior periods to be used for the treatment assignment}

\item{current_period}{The current period of the simulation. Defined by loop structure inside \code{\link[=run_mab_trial]{run_mab_trial()}}.}

\item{perfect_assignment}{Logical; if TRUE, assumes perfect information for treatment assignment
(i.e., all outcomes are observed regardless of the date).
If FALSE, hides outcomes not yet theoretically observed, based on
\code{letter_sent_date} from the \code{tanf} dataset.}

\item{assignment_date_col}{Column in data, contains date of wave assignment.}

\item{success_date_col}{Column in data, contains date each success occurred.}

\item{conditions}{Named Character vector containing treatment conditions, Control condition, must be named "Control".}
}
\value{
A data.frame, containing the number of successes, success rate, and number of people for each
treatment condition.
}
\description{
Part of the Multi-Arm Bandit Trial Pipeline. This function filters the data by
the prior periods, calculates the success and success rate by treatment group to be used to
assign treatments via a Multi-Arm Bandit Algorithm. Provides functionality for simulating
the lack of information during assignment periods.
