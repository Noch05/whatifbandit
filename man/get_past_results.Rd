\title{Gather Past Results for Given Assignment Period}
\usage{
get_past_results(
  current_data,
  prior_data,
  perfect_assignment,
  assignment_date_col = NULL,
  success_date_col = NULL,
  conditions
)
}
\arguments{
\item{current_data}{Data with only observations from the current resampling period}

\item{prior_data}{Data with only the observbations from the prior index}

\item{perfect_assignment}{Logical; if TRUE, assumes perfect information for treatment assignment
(i.e., all outcomes are observed regardless of the date).
If FALSE, hides outcomes not yet theoretically observed, based on
\code{letter_sent_date} from the \code{tanf} dataset.}

\item{assignment_date_col}{Column in data, contains date of wave assignment.}

\item{success_date_col}{Column in data, contains date each success occurred.}

\item{conditions}{Named Character vector containing treatment conditions, Control condition, must be named "Control".}
}
\value{
A data.frame, containing the number of successes, and number of people for each
treatment condition.
}
\description{
This Function Summarizes the results of prior periods to be used for next Multi-Arm Bandit
Sampling period.
