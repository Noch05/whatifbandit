\title{Gather Past Results for Given Assignment Period}
\usage{
get_past_results(
  current_data,
  prior_data = NULL,
  perfect_assignment,
  assignment_date_col = NULL,
  conditions,
  current_period = NULL,
  prior = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{current_data}{Data with only observations from the current sampling period; if \code{data} is a data.table,
this is the whole dataset.}

\item{prior_data}{Data with only the observations from the prior index; only used when \code{data} is not a data.table}

\item{perfect_assignment}{Logical; if TRUE, assumes perfect information for treatment assignment
(i.e., all outcomes are observed regardless of the date).
If FALSE, hides outcomes not yet theoretically observed, based
on the dates treatments would have been assigned for each wave.}

\item{assignment_date_col}{Column in data, contains original dates treatments are assigned to observations; only necessary when 'perfect_assignment' = FALSE.}

\item{conditions}{Named Character vector containing treatment conditions.
Control condition, must be named "Control" when 'control_augment' > 0.}

\item{current_period}{current_period of the simulation.}

\item{prior}{vector of prior periods to use for bandit calculations.}
}
\value{
A data.frame, containing the number of successes, and number of people for each
treatment condition.
}
\description{
Summarizes results of prior periods to use for the current Multi-Arm-Bandit assignment.
