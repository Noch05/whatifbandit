fix_negatives(assignment_probs, conditions, iter = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{assignment_probs}{Named Numeric Vector; Containing probabilities of treatment assignment}

\item{conditions}{A named character vector containing treatment conditions. The elements
of this vector should be the names of each treatment as seen in your data, so to create it you can simply call
\code{unique(df$cond)}. The names of each element are used to reference the contents but are not inherently important;
choose names that are meaningful and consistent. If \code{control_augment} > 0, then the control condition
of the trial in this vector must have the name "Control".}

\item{iter, }{iteration tracker, stops function if it reaches the limit of}
}
\value{
Named Numeric Vector; Containing probabilities of treatment assignment, all positive.

Redistributes Probabilities when control augmentation produces negatives
