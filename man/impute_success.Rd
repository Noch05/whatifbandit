impute_success(
  current_data,
  imputation_info,
  id_col,
  success_col,
  prior_data,
  perfect_assignment,
  dates = NULL,
  success_date_col
)
}
\arguments{
\item{imputation_info}{A data frame object created by \code{\link[=imputation_prep]{imputation_prep()}}
contains the probabilities of success for each treatment condition, and block, if blocked
by service center, to be passed to \code{\link[randomizr:block_and_cluster_ra]{randomizr::block_and_cluster_ra()}} for the
probabilities of imputation.}

\item{prior_data}{A data frame containing results from previous periods, to be joined together at the end,
and passed into the next loop of the assignment process defined by \code{\link[=run_mab_trial]{run_mab_trial()}}.}

\item{perfect_assignment}{Logical; if TRUE, assumes perfect information for treatment assignment
(i.e., all outcomes are observed regardless of the date).
If FALSE, hides outcomes not yet theoretically observed, based
on the dates treatments would have been assigned for each wave.}

\item{data}{A data frame object created by \code{\link[=assign_treatments]{assign_treatments()}},
containing the new treatment conditions and whose outcome needs to be imputed}
}
\description{
Imputes Outcomes for the current treatment assignment period. Uses data from original RCT
and \link{randomizr} to randomly assign success of the new treatments under the MAB procedure based on the success rates
of each treatment during the original experiment. Runs in loop defined by \code{\link[=run_mab_trial]{run_mab_trial()}}.
