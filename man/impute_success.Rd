)
}
\arguments{
\item{imputation_info}{A data frame object created by \code{\link[=imputation_prep]{imputation_prep()}}
contains the probabilities of success for each treatment condition, and block, if blocked
by service center, to be passed to \code{\link[randomizr:block_and_cluster_ra]{randomizr::block_and_cluster_ra()}} for the
probabilities of imputation.}

\item{id_col}{Column in data, contains unique id as a key}

\item{condition_col}{Column in data, contains original treatment conditions}

\item{success_col}{Column in data, contains binary successes}

\item{success_date_col}{Column in data, contains date each success occurred}

\item{prior_data}{A data frame containing results from previous periods, to be joined together at the end,
and passed into the next loop of the assignment process defined by \code{\link[=run_mab_trial]{run_mab_trial()}}.}

\item{conditions}{Named Character vector containing treatment conditions, Control condition, must be named "Control"}

\item{perfect_assignment}{Logical; if TRUE, assumes perfect information for treatment assignment
(i.e., all outcomes are observed regardless of the date).
If FALSE, hides outcomes not yet theoretically observed, based on
\code{letter_sent_date} from the \code{tanf} dataset.}

\item{data}{A data frame object created by \code{\link[=assign_treatments]{assign_treatments()}},
containing the new treatment conditions and whose outcome needs to be imputed}
}
\description{
Imputes Outcomes for the current treatment assignment period. Uses data from original RCT
and \link{randomizr} to randomly assign success of the new treatments under the MAB procedure based on the success rates
of each treatment during the original experiment. Runs in loop defined by \code{\link[=run_mab_trial]{run_mab_trial()}}.
