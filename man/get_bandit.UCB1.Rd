\title{UCB1 Sampling Algorithm}
\usage{
\method{get_bandit}{ucb1}(past_results, conditions, current_period)
}
\arguments{
\item{past_results}{Tibble/data.table containing summary of prior periods, with
successes, number of observations, and success rates, which is created by \code{\link[=get_past_results]{get_past_results()}}.}

\item{current_period}{Numeric scalar; current period of the adaptive trial simulation.}
}
\value{
A named list with 2 elements: a tibble/data.table containing UCB1 and success rate for each condition,
and a named numeric vector of assignment probabilities, where the highest UCB1 out of the treatments
is assigned 1, and the rest 0.
}
\description{
Calculates upper confidence bounds for each treatment arm
