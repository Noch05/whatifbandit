\title{UCB1 Sampling Algorithm}
\usage{
\method{get_bandit}{UCB1}(past_results, conditions, current_period)
}
\arguments{
\item{past_results}{Tibble/data.table containing summary of prior periods, with
successes, number of observations, and success rates, which is created by \code{\link[=get_past_results]{get_past_results()}}.}

\item{conditions}{A named character vector containing treatment conditions. The elements
of this vector should be the names of each treatment as seen in your data, so to create it you can simply call
\code{unique(df[[condition_col]])}. The names of each element are used to refer to the contents but are
not inherently important; choose names
choose names that are meaningful and consistent. If \code{control_augment} > 0, then the control condition
of the trial in this vector must have the name "Control".}

\item{current_period}{Numeric scalar; current period of the adaptive trial simulation.}
}
\value{
A named list with 2 elements: a tibble/data.table containing UCB1 and success rate for each condition,
and a named numeric vector of assignment probabilities, where the highest UCB1 out of the treatments
is assigned 1, and the rest 0.
}
\description{
Calculates upper confidence bounds for each treatment arm
