\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.frame, data.table, or tibble containing input data from the trial. This should be the results
of a traditional Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT). data.frames will be converted to tibbles internally.}

\item{time_unit}{A character string specifying the unit of time for assigning periods when \code{assignment_method} is "Date".
Acceptable values are "Day", "Week", or "Month". "Month" is a special case that is useful when an experiment
defines the months differently then the genuine dates, i.e. an experiment considers August as starting
the in the second half of July, or when exact calender months are required for the periods, not just
a lengths of time in the month range. As such it requires an additional column to be provided,
with the exact month desired for each observation, and it treats each observation
as occurring on the first of that month. It is also useful when dates are not provided, here
synthetic dates should be created placing each observation on the first on its specified month.}

\item{perfect_assignment}{A logical value; if TRUE, assumes perfect information for treatment assignment
(i.e., all outcomes are observed regardless of the date).
If FALSE, hides outcomes not yet theoretically observed, based
on the dates treatments would have been assigned for each wave.
This is useful when simulating batch-based assignment where treatments were assigned
on a given day whether or not all the information from a prior batch was available and
you have exact dates treatments were assigned.}

\item{algorithm}{A character string specifying the MAB algorithm to use. Options are "Thompson" or "UCB1".}

\item{period_length}{A numeric value of length 1; represents the length of each treatment period.
If assignment method is "Date", this refers to the
length of periods by your specified \code{time_unit} (i.e., if "Day", 10 would be 10 days).
If assignment method is "Batch", this refers to the number of people in each batch. This factor
contributes most to the computational cost of calling the function, as large batch sizes make each iteration of
the simulation run slower, while each additional period adds time because of the extra iterations.
If you have a large dataset, consider passing it as a data.table.}

\item{prior_periods}{A numeric value of length 1, or the character string "All"; number of previous periods to use
in the treatment assignment model. This is used to implement the stationary/non-stationary bandit.
For example, a non-stationary bandit assumes the true probability of success for each treatment changes over time, so to
account for that, not all prior data should be used when making decisions because it could be "out of date".}

\item{whole_experiment}{A logical value; if TRUE, uses all past experimental data for imputing outcomes.
If FALSE, uses only data available up to the current period. In large datasets or with a high number
of periods, setting this to FALSE can be more computationally intensive, though not a significant
contributor to total runtime.}

\item{conditions}{A named character vector containing treatment conditions. The elements
of this vector should be the names of each treatment as seen in your data, so to create it you can simply call
\code{unique(df[[condition_col_name]])}. The names of each element are used to reference the contents but are not inherently important;
choose names that are meaningful and consistent. If \code{control_augment} > 0, then the control condition
of the trial in this vector must have the name "Control".}

\item{blocking}{A logical value; whether or not to use treatment blocking. Treatment blocking is used to ensure an even-enough
distribution of treatment conditions across blocks. For example, blocking by gender would mean the randomized assignment should
split treatments evenly not just throughout the sample (so for 4 arms, 25-25-25-25), but also within each block, so 25\% of men
would receive each treatment and 25\% of women the same.}

\item{block_cols}{A character vector of variables to block by. This vector should not be named.}

\item{data_cols}{A named character vector containing the names of columns in \code{data} as strings:
\itemize{
\item \code{id_col}: Column in \code{data}; contains unique ID as a key.
\item \code{success_col}: Column in \code{data}; binary successes from the original experiment.
\item \code{condition_col}: Column in \code{data}; original treatment condition for each observation.
\item \code{date_col}: Column in \code{data}; contains original date of event/trial. Only necessary when assigning by "Date". Must be of type \code{Date}, not a character string.
\item \code{month_col}: Column in \code{data}; contains month of treatment. Only necessary when \code{time_unit = "Month"}. This can be a string or factor variable
containing the names or numbers of months.
\item \code{success_date_col}: Column in \code{data}; contains original dates each success occurred. Only necessary when \code{perfect_assignment = FALSE}. Must be of type \code{Date}, not a character string.
\item \code{assignment_date_col}: Column in \code{data}; contains original dates treatments were assigned to observations. Only necessary when \code{perfect_assignment = FALSE}.
Used to simulate imperfect information on the part of researchers conducting an adaptive trial. Must be of type \code{Date}, not a character string.
}}

\item{verbose}{A logical value; whether or not to print intermediate messages. Default is FALSE.}

\item{assignment_method}{A character string; one of "Date", "Batch", or "Individual", to define the assignment into treatment waves. When using
"Batch" or "Individual", ensure your dataset is pre-arranged in the proper order observations should be considered so that
groups are assigned correctly. For "Date", observations will be considered in chronological order.
"Individual" assignment can be time-consuming for larger datasets.}

\item{control_augment}{A numeric value ranging from 0 to 1; proportion of each wave guaranteed to receive the "Control" treatment.
Default is 0.}

\item{imputation_information}{Object created by \code{\link[=imputation_precompute]{imputation_precompute()}} containing the conditional means and success dates
for each treatment block to impute from.}

\item{ndraws}{A logical value; If TRUE, numerical corrections are made to the input
vector of success and total trials to when the Thompson Sampling procedure returns a vector
of 0's or NaN's due to overflow. The vectors are divided by 2, maintaining the proportions of
success to total trials in each arm, but this may impact the variance of the distribution. This occurs
recursively a maximum of 50 times before throwing an error. By default this is FALSE.}
