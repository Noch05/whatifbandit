\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame that provides the input data for the trial.}

\item{time_unit}{A string specifying the unit of time for assigning periods.
Acceptable values are "Day", "Week", or "Month".}

\item{perfect_assignment}{Logical; if TRUE, assumes perfect information for treatment assignment
(i.e., all outcomes are observed regardless of the date).
If FALSE, hides outcomes not yet theoretically observed, based on
\code{letter_sent_date} from the \code{tanf} dataset.}

\item{algorithm}{A string specifying the MAB algorithm to use. Options are "Thompson" or "UCB1".}

\item{period_length}{Numeric; length of each treatment period.
If assignment method is "Date", this refers to the
length of periods by your specified \code{time_unit} (i.e., if "Day", 10 would be 10 days).
If assignment methods is "Batch", this refers to the number of people in each batch.}

\item{prior_periods}{Numeric; number of previous periods to use in the treatment assignment model
or specify string "All" to use all previous periods.}

\item{whole_experiment}{Logical; if TRUE, uses all past experimental data for imputing outcomes.
If FALSE, uses only data available up to the current period.}

\item{conditions}{Named Character vector containing treatment conditions, Control condition, must be named "Control".}

\item{blocking}{Logical; Whether or not to use treatment blocking.}

\item{block_cols}{Character Vector of variables to block by.}

\item{date_col}{Column in data, contains date of treatment.}

\item{month_col}{Column in data, contains month of treatment.}

\item{id_col}{Column in data, contains unique id as a key.}

\item{condition_col}{Column in data, contains original treatment conditions.}

\item{success_col}{Column in data, contains binary successes.}

\item{success_date_col}{Column in data, contains date each success occurred.}

\item{assignment_date_col}{Column in data, contains date of wave assignment.}

\item{verbose}{Logical; Whether or not to print iteration number. FALSE by default.}

\item{assignment_method}{String; "Date" or "Batch" to define the assignment into treatment waves.}

\description{
This function acts as an internal helper to \code{\link[=single_mab_simulation]{single_mab_simulation()}}
and \code{\link[=multiple_mab_simulation]{multiple_mab_simulation()}} by providing a common framework for executing
a single Multi-Arm-Bandit Trial with adaptive inference. It assumes all inputs have
been preprocessed by \code{\link[=mab_prepare]{mab_prepare()}}, or inside of the wrappers. Centralizes
a single trial to prevent redundant loops.
