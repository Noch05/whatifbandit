\title{Checking if conditions vector is proper}
\usage{
check_conditions(conditions, data, data_cols, control_augment)
}
\arguments{
\item{conditions}{A named character vector containing treatment conditions. The elements
of this vector should be the names of each treatment as seen in your data, so to create it you can simply call
\code{unique(df[[condition_col]])}. The names of each element are used to reference the contents but are not inherently important;
choose names that are meaningful and consistent. If \code{control_augment} > 0, then the control condition
of the trial in this vector must have the name "Control".}

\item{data}{A data.frame, data.table, or tibble containing input data from the trial. This should be the results
of a traditional Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT). data.frames will be converted to tibbles internally.}

\item{data_cols}{A named character vector containing the names of columns in \code{data} as strings:
\itemize{
\item \code{id_col}: Column in \code{data}; contains unique ID as a key.
\item \code{success_col}: Column in \code{data}; binary successes from the original experiment.
\item \code{condition_col}: Column in \code{data}; original treatment condition for each observation.
\item \code{date_col}: Column in \code{data}; contains original date of event/trial. Only necessary when assigning by "Date". Must be of type \code{Date}, not a character string.
\item \code{month_col}: Column in \code{data}; contains month of treatment. Only necessary when \code{time_unit = "Month"}. This can be a string or factor variable
containing the names or numbers of months.
\item \code{success_date_col}: Column in \code{data}; contains original dates each success occurred. Only necessary when \code{perfect_assignment = FALSE}. Must be of type \code{Date}, not a character string.
\item \code{assignment_date_col}: Column in \code{data}; contains original dates treatments were assigned to observations. Only necessary when \code{perfect_assignment = FALSE}.
Used to simulate imperfect information on the part of researchers conducting an adaptive trial. Must be of type \code{Date}, not a character string.
}}

\item{control_augment}{A numeric value ranging from 0 to 1; proportion of each wave guaranteed to receive the "Control" treatment.
Default is 0. It is not recommended to use this in conjunction with \code{random_assign_prop}.}
}
\value{
Nothing; Throws an error if the conditions vector does not meet the
requirements for the user's specified settings.
}
\description{
Helper to \code{\link[=validate_inputs]{validate_inputs()}}. This function accepts the conditions
vector and checks whether it is valid based on the number of conditions in the
vector versus the data set, and if the names have been properly assigned for
control augmentation if used.
