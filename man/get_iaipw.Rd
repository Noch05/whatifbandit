\title{Calculate Individual AIPW For Each Treatment Condition}
\usage{
get_iaipw(data, assignment_probs, periods, conditions, verbose)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{\code{final_data} object from \code{\link[=run_mab_trial]{run_mab_trial()}}. Contains results of Multi-Arm-Bandit Simulation}

\item{assignment_probs}{\code{assignment_probs} object from \code{\link[=run_mab_trial]{run_mab_trial()}}. Contains probability
of receiving each treatment at each treatment period in the simulated trial.}

\item{periods}{Numeric; number of treatment waves.}

\item{conditions}{Named Character vector containing treatment conditions.
Control condition, must be named "Control" when 'control_augment' > 0.}

\item{verbose}{Logical; Whether or not to print iteration number. FALSE by default.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the data used in the MAB trial
with new columns corresponding to the individual AIPW estimate for each treatment condition, and
the probability of being assigned a given treatment condition.
}
\description{
Calculates the individual Augmented Inverse Probability Weighted Estimate (AIPW) of treatment
success for each treatment condition provided.
