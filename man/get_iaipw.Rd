\title{Calculate Individual AIPW For Each Treatment Condition}
\usage{
get_iaipw(data, assignment_probs, periods, conditions, verbose)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{\code{final_data} object from \code{\link[=run_mab_trial]{run_mab_trial()}}. Contains results of Multi-Arm-Bandit Simulation}

\item{assignment_probs}{\code{assignment_probs} object from \code{\link[=run_mab_trial]{run_mab_trial()}}. Contains probability
of receiving each treatment at each treatment period in the simulated trial.}

\item{periods}{Numeric; number of treatment waves.}

\item{conditions}{A named character vector containing treatment conditions. The elements
of this vector should be the names of each treatment as seen in your data, so to create it you can simply call
\code{unique(df[[condition_col_name]])}. The names of each element are used to reference the contents but are not inherently important;
choose names that are meaningful and consistent. If \code{control_augment} > 0, then the control condition
of the trial in this vector must have the name "Control".}

\item{verbose}{A logical value; whether or not to print intermediate messages. Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the data used in the MAB trial
with new columns corresponding to the individual AIPW estimate for each treatment condition, and
the probability of being assigned a given treatment condition.
}
\description{
Calculates the individual Augmented Inverse Probability Weighted Estimate (AIPW) of treatment
success for each treatment condition provided.
