\title{whatifbandit: Analyzing Randomized Experiments as Multi-Arm Bandits}
\description{
Simulates the results of completed randomized controlled trials, as if they had been conducted as adaptive Multi-Arm Bandit (MAB) trials instead. Augmented inverse probability weighted estimation (AIPW), outlined by Hadad et al. (2021) \doi{10.1073/pnas.2014602118}, is used to robustly estimate the probability of success for each treatment arm under the adaptive design. Provides customization options to simulate perfect/imperfect information, stationary/non-stationary bandits, blocked treatment assignments, along with control augmentation, and other hybrid strategies for assigning treatment arms. The methods used in simulation were inspired by Offer-Westort et al. (2021) \doi{10.1111/ajps.12597}.
