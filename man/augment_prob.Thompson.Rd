\title{Augment Prob For Thompson Sampling}
\usage{
\method{augment_prob}{Thompson}(assignment_probs, control_augment, conditions)
}
\arguments{
\item{assignment_probs}{Named numeric vector; contains probabilities of
assignment with the control condition named "Control".}

\item{control_augment}{A numeric value ranging from 0 to 1; proportion of each wave guaranteed to receive the "Control" treatment.
Default is 0.}

\item{conditions}{A named character vector containing treatment conditions. The elements
of this vector should be the names of each treatment as seen in your data, so to create it you can simply call
\code{unique(df[[condition_col_name]])}. The names of each element are used to reference the contents but are not inherently important;
choose names that are meaningful and consistent. If \code{control_augment} > 0, then the control condition
of the trial in this vector must have the name "Control".}
