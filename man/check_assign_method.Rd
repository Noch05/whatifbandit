\usage{
check_assign_method(assignment_method, time_unit, verbose, period_length)
}
\arguments{
\item{assignment_method}{A character string; one of "date", "batch", or "individual", to define the assignment into treatment waves. When using
"batch" or "individual", ensure your dataset is pre-arranged in the proper order observations should be considered so that
groups are assigned correctly. For "date", observations will be considered in chronological order.
"individual" assignment can be computationally intensive for larger datasets.}

\item{time_unit}{A character string specifying the unit of time for assigning periods when \code{assignment_method} is "date".
Acceptable values are "day", "week", or "month". "month" does not require an additional column with the months of each observation,
but it can accept a separate \code{month_col}. This should be used when the contents of that column are not simply what would be returned
by \code{lubridate::months(data$date_col)} or \code{format(data$date_col, "\%m")}, otherwise passing just a column of dates will suffice.}

\item{verbose}{Logical; whether or not to print intermediate messages. Default is FALSE.}

\item{period_length}{A numeric value of length 1; represents the length of each treatment period.
If assignment method is "date", this length refers the number of units specified in \code{time_unit}
(i.e., if "day", 10 would be 10 days). If assignment method is "batch", this refers to the number of people in each batch.}
}
\value{
Throws an error if the user is missing necessary arguments to
assign treatments or passes invalid ones.
}
\description{
Helper to \code{\link[=validate_inputs]{validate_inputs()}}. This function accepts arguments relating
to how treatment waves are assigned, and checks if they are valid, and if all
supporting arguments are passed as necessary.
