\usage{
check_assign_method(assignment_method, time_unit, verbose, period_length)
}
\arguments{
\item{assignment_method}{A character string; one of "Date", "Batch", or "Individual", to define the assignment into treatment waves. When using
"Batch" or "Individual", ensure your dataset is pre-arranged in the proper order observations should be considered so that
groups are assigned correctly. For "Date", observations will be considered in chronological order.
"Individual" assignment can be time-consuming for larger datasets.}

\item{time_unit}{A character string specifying the unit of time for assigning periods when \code{assignment_method} is "Date".
Acceptable values are "Day", "Week", or "Month". "Month" is a special case that is useful when an experiment
defines the months differently then the genuine dates, i.e. an experiment considers August as starting
the in the second half of July, or when exact calender months are required for the periods, not just
a lengths of time in the month range. As such it requires an additional column to be provided,
with the exact month desired for each observation passed as an integer, character, or factor. Each
observation is treated as occurring on the first of each month.}

\item{verbose}{A logical value; whether or not to print intermediate messages. Default is FALSE.}

\item{period_length}{A numeric value of length 1; represents the length of each treatment period.
If assignment method is "Date", this length refers the number of units specified in\code{time_unit}
(i.e., if "Day", 10 would be 10 days).
If assignment method is "Batch", this refers to the number of people in each batch. This factor
contributes most to the computational cost of calling the function, as large batch sizes make each iteration of
the simulation run slower, while each additional period adds time because of the extra iterations, so be exercise
caution with this argument.}
}
\value{
Nothing; Throws an error if the user is missing necessary arguments to
assign treatments or passes invalid ones.
}
\description{
Helper to \code{\link[=validate_inputs]{validate_inputs()}}. This function accepts arguments relating
to how treatment waves are assigned, and checks if they are valid, and if all
supporting arguments are passed as necessary.
