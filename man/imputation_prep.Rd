\usage{
imputation_prep(
  data,
  whole_experiment,
  success_col,
  perfect_assignment,
  success_date_col = NULL,
  condition_col = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame that provides the input data for the trial.}

\item{whole_experiment}{Logical; if TRUE, uses all past experimental data for imputing outcomes.
If FALSE, uses only data available up to the current period.}

\item{success_col}{Column in data, contains binary successes.}

\item{perfect_assignment}{Logical; if TRUE, assumes perfect information for treatment assignment
(i.e., all outcomes are observed regardless of the date).
If FALSE, hides outcomes not yet theoretically observed, based on
\code{letter_sent_date} from the \code{tanf} dataset.}

\item{success_date_col}{Column in data, contains date each success occurred.}

\item{condition_col}{Column in data, contains original treatment conditions.}
}
\value{
A named list containing:
\item{Probabilities}{summary data frame of success probabilities by treatment condition and blocking condition.}
\item{Dates}{Success Dates by condition, to be used for imputing new dates of success}

\description{
This function prepares
to have values of success imputed for those who were switched treatment conditions
by \code{\link[=assign_treatments]{assign_treatments()}}. Simply calculates the Probability of success based on
treatment condition, using original experimental data.
