\title{Prepping Data For Outcome Imputation}
\usage{
imputation_prep(data, whole_experiment, perfect_assignment, data_cols)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame, tibble or data.table that provides the input data for the trial.}

\item{whole_experiment}{Logical; if TRUE, uses all past experimental data for imputing outcomes.
If FALSE, uses only data available up to the current period.}

\item{perfect_assignment}{Logical; if TRUE, assumes perfect information for treatment assignment
(i.e., all outcomes are observed regardless of the date).
If FALSE, hides outcomes not yet theoretically observed, based
on the dates treatments would have been assigned for each wave.}

\item{data_cols}{Named Character vector containing the names of columns in data as strings:
\itemize{
\item{id_col:} {Column in data, contains unique id as a key}
\item{success_col:} {Column in data; Binary successes from original experiment}
\item{date_col:} {Column in data, contains original date of event/trial; only ncessary when assigning by 'Date'}
\item{month_col:} {Column in data, contains month of treatment; only necessary when time_unit = 'Month'}
\item{success_date_col:} {Column in data, contains original dates each success occured; only necessary when 'perfect_assignment' = FALSE}
\item{assignment_date_col:} {Column in data, contains original dates treatments are assigned to observations; only necessary when 'perfect_assignment' = FALSE.
Used to simulate imperfect information on part of researchers conducting an adaptive trial}}}
}
\value{
A named list containing:
\item{Probabilities}{summary data frame of success probabilities by treatment condition and blocking condition.}
\item{Dates}{Success Dates by condition, to be used for imputing new dates of success}
#' @seealso
\itemize{
\item \code{\link[=impute_success]{impute_success()}}
\item \code{\link[=run_mab_trial]{run_mab_trial()}}
}
}
\description{
This function prepares
to have values of success imputed for those who were switched treatment conditions
by \code{\link[=assign_treatments]{assign_treatments()}}. Simply calculates the Probability of success based on
treatment condition, using original experimental data.
