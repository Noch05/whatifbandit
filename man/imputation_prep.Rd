\title{Prepping Data For Outcome Imputation}
\usage{
imputation_prep(
  data,
  whole_experiment,
  current_period,
  success_col,
  current_data
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame that provides the input data for the trial.}

\item{whole_experiment}{Logical; if TRUE, uses all past experimental data for imputing outcomes.
If FALSE, uses only data available up to the current period.}

\item{current_period}{The current period of the simulation. Defined by loop structure inside \code{\link[=run_mab_trial]{run_mab_trial()}}.}

\item{success_col}{Column in data, contains binary successes}

\item{current_data}{data.frame, contains data from the period currently being imputed}
}
\value{
A summary data frame of success probabilities by treatment condition and blocking condition, passed to
\code{\link[=impute_success]{impute_success()}}
}
\description{
Called Internally by \code{\link[=run_mab_trial]{run_mab_trial()}}, this function prepares
to have values of success imputed for those who were switched treatment conditions
by \code{\link[=assign_treatments]{assign_treatments()}}. Simply calculates the Probability of success based on
treatment condition, using original experimental data.
Works to minimize errors from \link[randomizr:block_and_cluster_ra]{randomizr::block_and_cluster_ra}, when blocking by service center is used.
