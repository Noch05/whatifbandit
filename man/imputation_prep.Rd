\title{Prepping Data For Outcome Imputation}
\usage{
imputation_prep(data, whole_experiment, perfect_assignment, data_cols)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.frame, data.table, or tibble containing input data from the trial. This should be the results
of a traditional Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT). data.frames will be converted to tibbles internally.}

\item{whole_experiment}{A logical value; if TRUE, uses all past experimental data for imputing outcomes.
If FALSE, uses only data available up to the current period. In large datasets or with a high number
of periods, setting this to FALSE can be more computationally intensive, though not a significant
contributor to total runtime.}

\item{perfect_assignment}{A logical value; if TRUE, assumes perfect information for treatment assignment
(i.e., all outcomes are observed regardless of the date).
If FALSE, hides outcomes not yet theoretically observed, based
on the dates treatments would have been assigned for each wave.
This is useful when simulating batch-based assignment where treatments were assigned
on a given day whether or not all the information from a prior batch was available and
you have exact dates treatments were assigned.}

\item{data_cols}{A named character vector containing the names of columns in \code{data} as strings:
\itemize{
\item \code{id_col}: Column in \code{data}; contains unique ID as a key.
\item \code{success_col}: Column in \code{data}; binary successes from the original experiment.
\item \code{condition_col}: Column in \code{data}; original treatment condition for each observation.
\item \code{date_col}: Column in \code{data}; contains original date of event/trial. Only necessary when assigning by "Date". Must be of type \code{Date}, not a character string.
\item \code{month_col}: Column in \code{data}; contains month of treatment. Only necessary when \code{time_unit = "Month"}. This can be a string or factor variable
containing the names or numbers of months.
\item \code{success_date_col}: Column in \code{data}; contains original dates each success occurred. Only necessary when \code{perfect_assignment = FALSE}. Must be of type \code{Date}, not a character string.
\item \code{assignment_date_col}: Column in \code{data}; contains original dates treatments were assigned to observations. Only necessary when \code{perfect_assignment = FALSE}.
Used to simulate imperfect information on the part of researchers conducting an adaptive trial. Must be of type \code{Date}, not a character string.
}}
}
\value{
A named list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{success}: Object the same type as \code{data},
which contains probability of success for each treatment block for each treatment period.
\item \code{dates}: Average success date for each treatment block at each treatment period.
}
}
\description{
Pre-computes the conditional probabilities of success and dates of success for each distinct
treatment block to impute them in \code{\link[=mab_simulation]{mab_simulation()}} for those who get assigned new treatments.
