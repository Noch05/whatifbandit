\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame, tibble or data.table that provides the input data for the trial.}

\item{assignment_method}{String; "Date" or "Batch" to define the assignment into treatment waves.}

\item{algorithm}{A string specifying the MAB algorithm to use. Options are "Thompson" or "UCB1".}

\item{conditions}{Named Character vector containing treatment conditions.
Control condition, must be named "Control" when 'control_augment' > 0.}

\item{prior_periods}{Numeric; number of previous periods to use in the treatment assignment model
or specify string "All" to use all previous periods.}

\item{perfect_assignment}{Logical; if TRUE, assumes perfect information for treatment assignment
(i.e., all outcomes are observed regardless of the date).
If FALSE, hides outcomes not yet theoretically observed, based
on the dates treatments would have been assigned for each wave.}

\item{whole_experiment}{Logical; if TRUE, uses all past experimental data for imputing outcomes.
If FALSE, uses only data available up to the current period.}

\item{blocking}{Logical; Whether or not to use treatment blocking.}

\item{data_cols}{Named Character vector containing the names of columns in data as strings:
\itemize{
\item{id_col:} {Column in data, contains unique id as a key}
\item{success_col:} {Column in data; Binary successes from original experiment}
\item{date_col:} {Column in data, contains original date of event/trial; only ncessary when assigning by 'Date'}
\item{month_col:} {Column in data, contains month of treatment; only necessary when time_unit = 'Month'}
\item{success_date_col:} {Column in data, contains original dates each success occured; only necessary when 'perfect_assignment' = FALSE}
\item{assignment_date_col:} {Column in data, contains original dates treatments are assigned to observations; only necessary when 'perfect_assignment' = FALSE.
Used to simulate imperfect information on part of researchers conducting an adaptive trial}}}

\item{block_cols}{Character Vector of variables to block by.}

\item{time_unit}{A string specifying the unit of time for assigning periods when 'assignment_method` is 'date'.
Acceptable values are "Day", "Week", or "Month".}

\item{period_length}{Numeric; length of each treatment period.
If assignment method is "Date", this refers to the
length of periods by your specified \code{time_unit} (i.e., if "Day", 10 would be 10 days).
If assignment methods is "Batch", this refers to the number of people in each batch.}

\item{control_augment}{Number \eqn{\in} [0,1]; Proportion of each wave guaranteed to get "Control" treatment.
Default is 0.}

\item{verbose}{Logical; Whether or not to print iteration number. FALSE by default.}
}
\value{
No return value. Throws an error
if problems exist before running \link{single_mab_simulation}
or \code{\link[=multiple_mab_simulation]{multiple_mab_simulation()}}.

\description{
This function provides input validation,
checking to ensure that all required function arguments have been entered,
and that they do not conflict with one another. The goal is to provide the user
with informative error messages so they can quickly fix their usage of the function.
