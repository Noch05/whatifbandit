\usage{
impute_loop_prep(
  current_data,
  block_cols,
  imputation_information,
  current_period,
  whole_experiment,
  blocking,
  perfect_assignment
)
}
\arguments{
\item{current_data}{Data with only observations from the current sampling period; if \code{data} is a data.table,
this is the whole dataset.}

\item{block_cols}{Character Vector of variables to block by.}

\item{imputation_information}{Object created by \code{\link[=imputation_prep]{imputation_prep()}} containing the conditional means and success dates
for each treatment block to impute from.}

\item{current_period}{current_period of the simulation.}

\item{whole_experiment}{Logical; if TRUE, uses all past experimental data for imputing outcomes.
If FALSE, uses only data available up to the current period.}

\item{blocking}{Logical; Whether or not to use treatment blocking.}

\item{perfect_assignment}{Logical; if TRUE, assumes perfect information for treatment assignment
(i.e., all outcomes are observed regardless of the date).
If FALSE, hides outcomes not yet theoretically observed, based
on the dates treatments would have been assigned for each wave.}
}
\value{
A named list containing:
\itemize{

}
}
\description{
Prepares necessary data to be passed to\code{\link[=impute_success]{impute_success()}} to
impute outcomes properly. Subsets pre-computations and adds the \code{impute_block},
column to \code{current_data}
}
