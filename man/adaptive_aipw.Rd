\title{Calculate Adaptive AIPW Estimates}
\usage{
adaptive_aipw(data, assignment_probs, conditions, periods, verbose)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{\code{final_data} object from \code{\link[=run_mab_trial]{run_mab_trial()}}. Contains results of Multi-Arm-Bandit Simulation}

\item{assignment_probs}{\code{assignment_probs} object from \code{\link[=run_mab_trial]{run_mab_trial()}}. Contains probability
of receiving each treatment at each treatment period in the simulated trial.}

\item{conditions}{A named character vector containing treatment conditions. The elements
of this vector should be the names of each treatment as seen in your data, so to create it you can simply call
\code{unique(df[[condition_col_name]])}. The names of each element are used to reference the contents but are not inherently important;
choose names that are meaningful and consistent. If \code{control_augment} > 0, then the control condition
of the trial in this vector must have the name "Control".}

\item{periods}{Numeric; number of treatment waves.}

\item{verbose}{A logical value; whether or not to print intermediate messages. Default is FALSE.}
}
\description{
Takes the average of the individual AIPW scores created by \code{\link[=get_iaipw]{get_iaipw()}} for each period,
and assigns each estimate an adaptive weight based on a constant allocation rate across periods defined by
\href{https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.2014602118}{Hadad et. al (2021)} to calculate a final
estimate for each treatment condition.
