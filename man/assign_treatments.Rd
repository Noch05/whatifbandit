assign_treatments(
  current_data,
  probs,
  blocking = NULL,
  algorithm,
  id_col,
  conditions,
  condition_col,
  success_col
)
}
\arguments{
\item{probs}{Named Numeric Vector; Probability of Assignment for each treatment condition.}

\item{blocking}{Logical; Whether or not to use treatment blocking.}

\item{algorithm}{A string specifying the MAB algorithm to use. Options are "Thompson" or "UCB1".}

\item{id_col}{Column in data, contains unique id as a key.}

\item{conditions}{Named Character vector containing treatment conditions, Control condition, must be named "Control".}

\item{condition_col}{Column in data, contains original treatment conditions.}

\item{success_col}{Column in data, contains binary successes.}
}
\value{
An updated data frame object with the new treatment conditions. If this treatment is different
then from under the original experiment, they are labelled as imputation required.
}
\description{
Assigns new treatments for an assignment wave based on the assignment probabilities provided.
Probabilities passed to \code{\link[randomizr:block_and_cluster_ra]{randomizr::block_and_cluster_ra()}} or \code{\link[randomizr:cluster_ra]{randomizr::cluster_ra()}} for random assignment.
