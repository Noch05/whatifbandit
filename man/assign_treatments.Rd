assign_treatments(
  current_data,
  probs,
  blocking = NULL,
  algorithm,
  id_col,
  conditions,
  condition_col,

  current_period
)
}
\arguments{
\item{current_data}{Data with only observations from the current sampling period; if \code{data} is a data.table,
this is the whole dataset.}

\item{probs}{Named Numeric Vector; Probability of Assignment for each treatment condition.}

\item{blocking}{Logical; Whether or not to use treatment blocking.}

\item{algorithm}{A string specifying the MAB algorithm to use. Options are "Thompson" or "UCB1".}

\item{id_col}{Column in data, contains unique id as a key.}

\item{conditions}{Named Character vector containing treatment conditions.
Control condition, must be named "Control" when 'control_augment' > 0.}

\item{condition_col}{Column in data; Original Treatment condition for each observation.}

\item{success_col}{Column in data; Binary successes from original experiment.}

\item{current_period}{The current period of the simulation. Defined by loop structure inside \code{\link[=run_mab_trial]{run_mab_trial()}}.}
}
\value{
Updated \code{data} object with the new treatment conditions. If this treatment is different
then from under the original experiment, they are labelled as imputation required.
}
\description{
Assigns new treatments for an assignment wave based on the assignment probabilities provided.
Probabilities passed to \code{\link[randomizr:block_and_cluster_ra]{randomizr::block_and_cluster_ra()}} or \code{\link[randomizr:cluster_ra]{randomizr::cluster_ra()}} for random assignment.
