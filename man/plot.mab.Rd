\title{Plot Generic for \code{mab} objects}
\usage{
\method{plot}{mab}(x, type, estimator = NULL, level = 0.95, save = FALSE, path = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{mab} class object created by \code{\link[=single_mab_simulation]{single_mab_simulation()}}}

\item{type}{String; Type of plot requested; valid types are:
\itemize{
\item \code{arm}: Shows Thompson Probability or UCB1 Statistic over the trial period.
\item \code{assign}: Shows Assignment Probability/Proportion over trial period.
\item \code{estimate}: Shows proportion of success estimates with user specified Normal Confidence Intervals based on their estimated variance.
}}

\item{estimator}{Estimator to plot; Either "AIPW", "Sample" or "Both"; only used by "estimate" type}

\item{level}{Confidence Interval Width (i.e 0.90, .95, 0.99)}

\item{save}{Logical; Whether or not to save the plot to disk; FALSE by default.}

\item{path}{String; File directory to save file.}

\item{...}{arguments to pass to \verb{ggplot2:geom_*} function (e.g. \code{color}, \code{linewidth}, \code{alpha}, etc.)}
}
\value{
Minimal ggplot object, that can be customized and added to with \code{+} (To change, scales, labels, legend, theme, etc.)
}
\description{
Uses \code{\link[ggplot2:ggplot]{ggplot2::ggplot()}} to summarize the results of a single
Multi-Arm Bandit Trial
}
\examples{
# Objects returned by `single_mab_simulation()` have a `mab` class.
# This class has a plot generic that has several minimal plots to examine
# the trial quickly

# Loading Data and running a quick simulation
data(tanf)
x <- single_mab_simulation(
  data = tanf,
  algorithm = "Thompson",
  assignment_method = "Batch",
  period_length = 600,
  whole_experiment = TRUE,
  perfect_assignment = TRUE,
  blocking = FALSE,
  prior_periods = "All",
  conditions = c(
    "no_letter",
    "open_appt",
    "specific_appt"
  ),
  data_cols = c(
    condition_col = "condition",
    id_col = "id",
    success_col = "success"
  )
)

# The plot generic has several options
# specify type = arm, to plot the Thompson probabilities or UCB1 statistics
# over the treatment periods of the trial
y <- plot(x, type = "arm")
y
# These can be added to like any ggplot2 object

y + ggplot2::labs(title = "Your New Title")

# type = assign creates a similar plot, but its only useful when
# control_augmentation is > 0.


# Setting type = estiamte, allows for plotting of the
# Augmented Inverse Probability Estimates.
# By default it provides 95\% Normal Confidence Intervals but this can be adjusted
plot(x, type = "estimate", estimator = "AIPW")

# Each type only uses 1 ggplot2 geom* so any arguments for the particular geom
# can be added into the generic call
# Changing the height for `geom_errorbarh`
plot(x, type = "estimate", estimator = "AIPW", height = 0.4)
