\title{Create Treatment Wave Cutoffs}
\usage{
create_cutoff(
  data,
  data_cols,
  period_length = NULL,
  assignment_method,
  time_unit
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame, tibble or data.table that provides the input data for the trial.}

\item{data_cols}{Named Character vector containing the names of columns in data as strings:
\itemize{
\item{id_col:} {Column in data, contains unique id as a key}
\item{success_col:} {Column in data; Binary successes from original experiment}
\item{date_col:} {Column in data, contains original date of event/trial; only ncessary when assigning by 'Date'}
\item{month_col:} {Column in data, contains month of treatment; only necessary when time_unit = 'Month'}
\item{success_date_col:} {Column in data, contains original dates each success occured; only necessary when 'perfect_assignment' = FALSE}
\item{assignment_date_col:} {Column in data, contains original dates treatments are assigned to observations; only necessary when 'perfect_assignment' = FALSE.
Used to simulate imperfect information on part of researchers conducting an adaptive trial}}}

\item{period_length}{Numeric; length of each treatment period.
If assignment method is "Date", this refers to the
length of periods by your specified \code{time_unit} (i.e., if "Day", 10 would be 10 days).
If assignment methods is "Batch", this refers to the number of people in each batch.}

\item{assignment_method}{String; "Date" or "Batch" to define the assignment into treatment waves.}

\item{time_unit}{A string specifying the unit of time for assigning periods when 'assignment_method` is 'date'.
Acceptable values are "Day", "Week", or "Month".}
}
\value{
Updated \code{data} object with the new \code{period_number} column. \code{period_number} is an integer
representing an observation's new assignment period.
}
\description{
Used during \code{\link[=mab_prepare]{mab_prepare()}} to assign each observation a new treatment assignment period, based
on user-supplied specifications, and user supplied data from
\code{date_col} and \code{month_col} in \code{data_cols}.
