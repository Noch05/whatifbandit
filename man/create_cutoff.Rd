\usage{
create_cutoff(
  data,
  time_unit,
  date_col,
  month_col = NULL,
  period_length = NULL,
  success_col,
  condition_col,
  success_date_col,
  perfect_assignment
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame that provides the input data for the trial.}

\item{time_unit}{A string specifying the unit of time for assigning periods.
Acceptable values are "Individual", "Day", "Week", or "Month".}

\item{date_col}{Column in data, contains date of treatment}

\item{month_col}{Column in data, contains month of treatment}

\item{period_length}{Numeric; length of each treatment period, based on the \code{time_unit}.
For example, if \code{time_unit = "Day"} and \code{period_length = 10}, each period is 10 days long.}

\item{success_col}{Column in data, contains binary successes}

\item{condition_col}{Column in data, contains original treatment conditions}

\item{success_date_col}{Column in data, contains date each success occurred}

\item{perfect_assignment}{Logical; if TRUE, assumes perfect information for treatment assignment
(i.e., all outcomes are observed regardless of the date).
If FALSE, hides outcomes not yet theoretically observed, based on
\code{letter_sent_date} from the \code{tanf} dataset.}
}
\value{
data frame containing the original data with 5 additional columns.
\item{period_number}{Integer identifying the treatment wave for each observation}
\item{mab_success}{New variable to hold new success from Multi-arm bandit procedure, NA until assigned.}
\item{mab_condition}{New variable to hold new treatment condition from Multi-arm bandit procedure, NA until assigned.}
\item{impute_req}{Binary indicator for imputation requirement, NA until assigned}
\item{new_recert_date}{New variable to new recertification date from Multi-arm bandit procedure, NA until assigned.}
}
\description{
Used during \code{\link[=run_mab_trial]{run_mab_trial()}} to prepare data for the Multi-Arm-Bandit procedure, by assigning treatment
waves and initializing new columns
