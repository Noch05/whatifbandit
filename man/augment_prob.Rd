\title{Control Augmentation for Treatment Assignment}
\usage{
augment_prob(assignment_probs, control_augment, conditions, algorithm)
}
\arguments{
\item{assignment_probs}{Named numeric vector; contains probabilities of
assignment with the control condition named "Control".}

\item{control_augment}{Number \eqn{\in} [0,1]; Proportion of each wave guaranteed to get "Control" treatment.
Default is 0.}

\item{conditions}{Named Character vector containing treatment conditions.
Control condition, must be named "Control" when 'control_augment' > 0.}

\item{algorithm}{A string specifying the MAB algorithm to use. Options are "Thompson" or "UCB1".}
}
\value{
Named numeric vector with updated probabilities
}
\description{
Adjusts Probabilities of Assignment to match a control augmentation framework.
If probability threshold is not meant, values are adjusted uniformly to augment the control probability.
