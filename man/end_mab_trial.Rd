\title{Ends Multi-Arm Bandit Trial}
\usage{
end_mab_trial(data, bandits, algorithm, periods, conditions, ndraws)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Finalized data from \code{\link[=run_mab_trial]{run_mab_trial()}}.}

\item{bandits}{Finalized bandits list from \code{\link[=run_mab_trial]{run_mab_trial()}}.}

\item{algorithm}{A character string specifying the MAB algorithm to use. Options are "Thompson" or "UCB1". Algorithm
defines the adaptive assignment process. Mathematical details on these algorithms
can be found in \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.6028}{Kuleshov and Precup 2014} and
\href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07272}{Slivkins 2024}.}

\item{periods}{Numeric value of length 1; total number of periods in Multi-Arm-Bandit trial.}

\item{conditions}{A named character vector containing treatment conditions. The elements
of this vector should be the names of each treatment as seen in your data, so to create it you can simply call
\code{unique(df[[condition_col]])}. The names of each element are used to reference the contents but are not inherently important;
choose names that are meaningful and consistent. If \code{control_augment} > 0, then the control condition
of the trial in this vector must have the name "Control".}

\item{ndraws}{A numeric value; When Thompson Sampling direct calculations fail, draws from a simulated posterior
will be used to approximate the Thompson Sampling probabilities. This is the number of simulations to use, the default
is 5000 to match the default parameter \code{\link[bandit:best_binomial_bandit_sim]{bandit::best_binomial_bandit_sim()}}, but might need to be raised or lowered depending on performance and accuracy
concerns.}
}
\value{
A named list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{final_data}: The processed tibble or data.table, containing new columns pertaining to the results of the trial.
\item \code{bandits}: A tibble or data.table containing the UCB1 statistics or Thompson Sampling posterior distributions for each period.
\item \code{assignment_probs}: A tibble or data.table containing the probability of being assigned each treatment arm at a given period.
}
}
\description{
Condenses output from \code{\link[=run_mab_trial]{run_mab_trial()}} into
manageable structure.
}
\details{
Takes the bandit lists provided, and condenses them using \code{\link[dplyr:bind_rows]{dplyr::bind_rows()}}
into tibbles or data.tables, and then pivots the table
to wide format where each treatment arm is a column, and the rows
represent periods.

At this step the final UCB1 or Thompson Probabilities are calculated,
and the whole table is lead by one to have each period be represented
by the calculation that occurred just after completing the period, so
period 11 now means the bandit calculated in period 12, using the results
from period 11. The assignment probabilities are not changed in this way, so for each period
they still reflect the assignment probabilities used in that period.
