\title{Ends Multi-Arm Bandit Trial}
\usage{
end_mab_trial(data, bandits, algorithm, periods, conditions)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{finalized data from \code{\link[=run_mab_trial]{run_mab_trial()}}.}

\item{bandits}{Finalized bandits list from \code{\link[=run_mab_trial]{run_mab_trial()}}.}

\item{algorithm}{A character string specifying the MAB algorithm to use. Options are "Thompson" or "UCB1".}

\item{periods}{Numeric scalar; total number of periods in Multi-Arm-Bandit trial.}

\item{conditions}{A named character vector containing treatment conditions. The elements
of this vector should be the names of each treatment as seen in your data, so to create it you can simply call
\code{unique(df[[condition_col_name]])}. The names of each element are used to reference the contents but are not inherently important;
choose names that are meaningful and consistent. If \code{control_augment} > 0, then the control condition
of the trial in this vector must have the name "Control".}
}
\value{
A named list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{final_data}: Processed data with new treatment assignments and imputed outcomes labelled with "mab_" prefix.
\item \code{bandits}: Thompson Probability or UCB1 statistic for each treatment arm at each period of the simulation.
\item \code{assignment_probs}: Assignment probabilities for each treatment arm at each period of the simulation.
}
}
\description{
Condenses output from \code{\link[=run_mab_trial]{run_mab_trial()}} into
manageable structure.
