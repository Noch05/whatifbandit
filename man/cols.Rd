\arguments{
\item{id_col}{Column in \code{data}; contains unique ID as a key.}

\item{success_col}{Column in \code{data}; binary successes from the original experiment.}

\item{condition_col}{Column in \code{data}; original treatment condition for each observation.}

\item{date_col}{Column in \code{data}; contains original date of event/trial. Only necessary when assigning by "Date". Must be of type \code{Date}, not a character string.}

\item{month_col}{Column in \code{data}; contains month of treatment. Only necessary when \code{time_unit = "Month"}, and the months described are different
then what would be returned by \code{lubridate::months(data$date_col)} or \code{format(data$date_col, "\%m")}. This can be a numeric, string, or factor variable
containing the names or numbers of the months.}

\item{success_date_col}{Column in \code{data}; contains original dates each success occurred. Only necessary when \code{perfect_assignment = FALSE}. Must be of type \code{Date}, not a character string.}

\item{assignment_date_col}{Column in \code{data}; contains original dates treatments were assigned to observations. Only necessary when \code{perfect_assignment = FALSE}.
Used to simulate imperfect information on the part of researchers conducting an adaptive trial. Must be of type \code{Date}, not a character string.}
